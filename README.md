Unofficial Draft of the Shutesbury Broadband FAQ
================================================

Work area for developing documents related to broadband in Shutesbury, MA, and collaborative
editing of those documents.

Anything you read here is 100% unofficial - see [the town web site](http://www.shutesbury.org/broadband) for
the real thing.

**The [draft FAQ is here](./broadbandFaq.md).**


## How To Submit Edits / Corrections / Revisions

If you are technical, this site has great tools for tracking requests for changes - [report an issue here](/timboudreau/shutesburybroadband/issues).  If you use Git, [*pull requests* are the way to make an edit](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) and request that the author incorporate your changes.

If that sounds too complicated, [download or copy/paste the raw FAQ document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timboudreau/shutesburybroadband/master/broadbandFaq.md), make your edits and email them to [Tim Boudreau](mailto:niftiness@gmail.com).

The only caveat to sending edits is:  *do not make gratuitous changes to formatting - change what you think can be improved and only that*.  The history of a document - who did what and when - is per *line*.  So gratuitous changes make it complicated to tell who changed what.

Do not send changes Microsoft Word or other proprietary formats - such tools are not available to everyone, and therefore inappropriate for public documents; and such tools are highly likely to alter the formatting unnecessarily.  The point of using a plain-text format is that even the simplest text editor is sufficient.


## Document Format

The document is in [plain-text Markdown format](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) which can be edited in any text editor program, even super-simple ones like Microsoft Notepad.

It is a simple format that requires no technical expertise or special software you have to pay for.


## Why Use GitHub?

Transparency.  Git is a tool used by software engineers to collaborate on living documents.  It guarantees that:

 - Auditability - who did each edit, when and what was changed are [completely transparent](https://github.com/timboudreau/shutesburybroadband/commit/c5b6a92d2f998725117f017f7bec14bf54182080#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8)
 - History is preserved - any historical revision of a document can be seen at any time
 - Comparisons - it is possible to [see changes side-by-side](https://github.com/timboudreau/shutesburybroadband/commits/master/broadbandFaq.md)
